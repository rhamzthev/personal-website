## Description

A modern, responsive personal portfolio website showcasing my work as a full-stack developer. This project features a clean, minimalist design with dynamic content pulled from GitHub, syntax-highlighted project READMEs, and a contact form with email integration.

The site is built with Next.js, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, implementing best practices for performance, accessibility, and responsive design across all device sizes.
